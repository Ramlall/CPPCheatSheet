# Algorithm Cheat Sheet

This file contains code examples for using each of C++'s useful data structures. 

The code here will mostly be used as a reference by me for when I'm in an algorithm contest
and need to remember how to use a certain data structure, or how to use a Node instead of 
a primitive data type.
